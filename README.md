CampAlpha ðŸš€
A hyperlocal social network designed exclusively for college life. CampAlpha goes beyond a simple feed, integrating into the daily fabric of campus with features for social planning, academic collaboration, and real-time campus updates.

About The Project
Traditional social media is too broad. CampAlpha is built on the idea that the most meaningful connections and information are local. This app is designed to be an indispensable tool for college students, combining the best elements of a social feed with high-utility features that solve the unique challenges of campus life.

From finding out which dining hall has the best food right now to organizing a last-minute study group for a midterm, CampAlpha aims to be the central hub for a student's entire world.
